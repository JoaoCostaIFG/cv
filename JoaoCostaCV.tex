\section{Bio}

I like working in almost everything software related. My work experience mainly focuses
on embedded software development, focusing on safety-critical systems, but I consider
myself a generalist. This last year I started working in backend software development
at a startup.

I get most of my knowledge/experience from my personal projects outside of work. These
projects involve informatics and electronics, spanning the whole tech stack. I'm also
a big fan of open-source software and try to contribute to it as much as I can.

In my free time, you can find me working on personal projects, reading, or playing
video games. I'm also a big fan of paintball and cycling.

\begin{twenty}
  \twentyitem{2023}{Octree implementation for SLAM}
    {\twentyshortghref{https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/slam}{Project's GitHub page}}
    {An Octree implementation in C++ for use in SLAM application for an autonomous
    submarine. This project was developed for the university's robotics research
    institute. The objective was improving the performance of existing Octree
    implementations for the current application without compromising the
    spacial efficiency and accuracy.}
  \twentyitem{2022}{TraSMAPy}
    {\twentyshortghref{https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/TraSMAPy}{Project's GitHub page}}
    {A Python API for the \href{https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/}{SUMO traffic simulator} with the
    objective of allowing researchers with limited knowledge in informatics and programming to
    model road traffic simulations. The API abstracts lower level concepts of the simulator and
    builds new concepts to make it easier to build agent-based simulations,}
  \twentyitem{2022}{µKernel}
    {\twentyshortghref{https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/SETR/tree/master/uKernel}{Project's GitHub page}}
    {A real-time micro-kernel for the Arduino UNO supporting POSIX style tasks, mutexes,
    EDF scheduling, task sleeping, and assertions. Responsible for most of the implementation
    and research for the project.}
